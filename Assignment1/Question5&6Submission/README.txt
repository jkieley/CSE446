While Both my WCF Service and ASP .Net Web Forms Site are within the same Visual Studio Solution.
Visual Studio stores them in different folders. To maintain the folder structure I have included both folder structures.

\Projects\WCFService1\WCFService1.v12

ASP .Net Web Forms Site can be found in:
